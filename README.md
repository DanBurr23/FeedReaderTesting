Feed Reader Testing for FE nanodegree

To launch this app, you can double click on the index.html file, or open it directly in a browser

Upon launching, you will see a list of feeds from the udacity feed. There is a "hamburger" icon on the left which you can use to select certain blog feeds. 

At the bottom of the page, you will see the automated tests which I built into the application using the jasmine framework.
